“CallBack: The Arguments Within,” a specific 2D platform game whose aims were to combine logical programming and interaction with a game.” The game is crafted in such a way that a player can only progress by calling functions like move_obj() or open_gate(), which is how functions operate in programming. The title “CallBack” refers to both the technical term and the act of reapplying what one has been taught and learned. Players are solving fragments of logical statements based on Python syntax scattered in blocks throughout the game. These are the means for restoring the ‘System’ and completing the game. The game uses two main types of play: writing simple programs in Python and solving logic problems. It is educational and fun at the same time.
